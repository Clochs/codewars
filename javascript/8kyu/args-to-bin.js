// Given an array add all the number elements and return the binary equivalent of that sum; to make the code bullet proof anything else than a number should be added as 0 since it can't be added.
// If your language can handle float binaries assume the array won't contain float or doubles.

// My solution

function arr2bin(arr) {
    let sum = arr.reduce((total, num) => {
        
    })    
}
